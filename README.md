The viral New York Times game is now playable in your terminal! Can you guess the secret word before running out of tries?

The game works on both Windows and Linux (tested on Ubuntu). Words are dynamically fetched using @mcnaveen's [Random Words API](https://github.com/mcnaveen/Random-Words-API)!

This project was initially made as a "playground" where I learn and apply numerous new concepts such as CMake, Google Tests and GitHub Actions.

It also serves as a starting point for a bigger upcoming console app project, which will be the spiritual successor to my [hOS](https://github.com/itshichabk/hOS_Cpp) project.

### To do:

- [x] Fix case sensitivity
- [ ] Only allow actual words (no random gibberish)
- [ ] Menu / splash screen
- [ ] Game stats?
- [ ] Actual NYT Wordle API?
